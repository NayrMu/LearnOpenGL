# LearnOpenGL

## What is this project?

This is a learning project for me, I'm folowing along the LearnOpenGL tutorial found here. Except I've added a twist, 
I'm doing it all in C instead of C++, and I'm rewriting the GLM features and functions myself. Now, there is no real reason to do so
other than my simple desire to do it, there is no performance gain and if anything there will probably be a small performance loss 
by remaking what others have already tested. But I will be following along the tutorial and doing everything I feel up to doing in C.

## Why is this project?

For starters I want to learn C, I've already played around some with C++ and I wanted to see what programming without all the overhead
and OOP of C++ was like. I also have an interest in grahpical programming and figured this could be a cool project to learn C. I also really
hate the process of linking/downloading/using a bunch of various libraries so I decided to go as low level as I could and just do it all myself.
One day I will learn CMake, but today is not that day.

## Current Progress

I've got a spinning cube with a brick texture, the z-filtering has not yet bee implemented and the faces are currently a little jacked up.
